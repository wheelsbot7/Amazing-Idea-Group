The Amazing ideas group's website is designed to allow users to create a project idea, and then submit it on to a publicly available
page where they can be viewed in detail. This will be useful for categorizing projects / project ideas for ease of understanding,
and it will also provide a more streamlined way for the Software Engineering class to display projects new teams may undertake.
