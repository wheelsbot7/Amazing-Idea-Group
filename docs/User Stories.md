The Amazing ideas group's website is designed to allow users to create a project idea, and then submit it on to a publicly available
page where they can be viewed in detail. This will be useful for categorizing projects / project ideas for ease of understanding,
and it will also provide a more streamlined way for the Software Engineering class to display projects new teams may undertake.

Johnathan needed an idea for his computer science capstone project. He checked the database for previous project, and took inspiration from a graduate who built a website to document wildlife sightings. He referenced that project's code to build a miniature social network that encouraged its users to post wildlife photos, effectively crowdsourcing wildlife data gathering. This became a valuable tool for environmental researchers interested in monitoring the population of local wildlife.
